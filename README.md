# EMI Calculator

A modern, responsive EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator built with React and Material UI. This application helps users calculate loan EMIs with real-time currency conversion capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **EMI Calculation**: Calculate loan EMIs using standard financial formulas
- **Dynamic Amortization Schedule**: View detailed monthly breakdown of payments
- **Real-time Currency Conversion**: Convert EMIs to different currencies using live exchange rates
- **Multi-currency Support**: Access exchange rates for 160+ currencies
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI that works on all screen sizes
- **Theme Support**: Toggle between light and dark modes
- **Mobile-friendly Navigation**: Collapsible header for better mobile experience

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: Hooks, Routing, Context API
- **Material UI**: Styling and responsive components
- **Axios**: API calls
- **Exchange Rate API**: Real-time currency conversion

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- An API key from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your ExchangeRate API key:
```
REACT_APP_EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## 💡 EMI Formula

The application uses the standard EMI formula:

```
EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]
```

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- R = Monthly interest rate (annual rate/12/100)
- N = Loan duration in months

## 🔄 API Integration

The app integrates with the ExchangeRate-API for live currency conversion:

```
https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR_API_KEY/latest/USD
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from ExchangeRate-API.

- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Loading states for API calls
- Input validation for calculator fields

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **State Management**: Use Context API for global state (theme, currency)
2. **Custom Hooks**: Create reusable hooks for EMI calculation and API calls
3. **Code Organization**: Follow the project structure for better maintainability
4. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
5. **Responsive Design**: Test on multiple screen sizes
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
